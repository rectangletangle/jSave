jSave
======
This library acts as a persistence abstraction layer for client-side
JavaScript. This allows for the persistent storage of JSON compatible objects
using HTML5's `localStorage` or cookies, using a single interface. This
facilitates robust client-side storage, using `localStorage` as the preferred
mechanism while utilizing cookies as a fallback.

## Usage:
```javascript
```

## Dependencies:
* QUnit (only for testing)
